# Country, Weather & Exchange Rate App 

   

# Introduction 

Bugsey is an Ionic mobile application developed using Angular as an individual project for the "Mobile Applications Development" module as part of the Higher Diploma in 
Computer Science (Software Development) at Atlantic Technological Institute, Galway, Ireland. 

It fetches weather and exchange rate data from internet resources via APIs to provide country information, weather updates, and currency exchange rates. 

Bugsey uses Capacitor for native app development, allowing you to deploy the app to iOS and Android devices.
